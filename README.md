'Simulations.R': script to run simulations for all models, including parameter sampling, burn in phase and model run. Calls the 'Model_functions.R' script which contains all model functions used by DeSolve.

'Assemble_output.R' assembles several simulations output together and compute measures of public health impact: prevalence, mortality, average length of infection and morbidity for each model output and extract measures of proportion of front line drug usage and bystander selection.
